##  Dataset

**Dataset:** [GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)

The dataset includes:
- **dt** ‚Äì Date of record (from 1743 to 2013)  
- **AverageTemperature** ‚Äì Average recorded temperature  
- **Country** ‚Äì Country name for which data was recorded  

The dataset contains over 500,000 records of temperature readings across countries.

##  Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing plays a crucial role in improving model accuracy and stability. The following steps were applied:

1. **Missing Value Handling:**  
   Missing temperature values were filled using **linear interpolation**.

2. **Outlier Removal:**  
   Applied **Z-score filtering** to remove anomalous readings.

3. **Datetime Conversion:**  
   Converted `dt` into datetime format and extracted **Year** and **Month** features.

4. **Aggregation:**  
   Grouped data to compute **monthly** and **yearly average temperatures**.

5. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - **Rolling Mean & Standard Deviation (12-month window)** ‚Äì Captures trends  
   - **Cyclical Month Encoding** using sine and cosine transformations  
   - **Lag Features** to capture temporal dependencies  
   - **MinMax Scaling** to normalize input values

##  Models Trained

The project evaluates both **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** approaches:

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R¬≤ Score | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Linear Regression** | 3.894 | 3.960 | -122.505 | Simple linear relationship baseline |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | 0.329 | 0.425 | -0.422 | Ensemble-based tree model |
| **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)** | 1.214 | 1.571 | -19.156 | Captures non-linear patterns |
| **LSTM (Deep Learning)** | **0.214** | **0.258** | **0.964** | Learns temporal dependencies effectively |

 **Result:**  
The **LSTM model** achieved the best performance, demonstrating its ability to capture long-term temperature trends and sequential patterns in climate data.
